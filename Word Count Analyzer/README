This program was difficult to implement, given the intracacies of Hash Tables. 
I had to spend some time relearning hash tables. Once I had basic understanding 
covered, I was able to write this program. The challenge from this program came 
through sorting. Thankfully, I was able to implement storeValue, which took care 
of the majority of the issues. I had some trouble debugging the code, specifically 
where the request was either outside the max number of word length, or max number 
of frequency. Thankfully, I was able to deduce a solution and get my program to 
function properly.
